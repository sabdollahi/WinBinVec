# WinBinVec
In this repository, we implemented five different deep learning architecture for cancer prediction using protein-protein interactions' sequences:
WinBinVec (Window-based Binary Vectors), WinSelfAtt (Window-based Self Attention), BindingAffinity (Binding affinity changes upon mutations), gGapDipeptide (g gap dipeptide modeling of protein-protein interactions), and SMFM (Single Matrix Factorization Model).
Furthermore, this repository provides the codes for data processing and data cleaning including: PDB-related processing, Standard deviation of the mutation accumulation, Extraction of the positions of the available amino acids in each PDB files, Window selection method, and plotting some figures.
